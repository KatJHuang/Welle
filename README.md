Welle or Wave is a mini-project created at LadyHacks, York University.
It's a gesture-controlled remote for playing music. 
It makes use of Leap motion sensor to detect hand movements.
You can wave in front of the sensor to change the volume.

If I don't die from school, I'll (hopefully) add more functionalities, for example:
- gesture controlled audio engineering - air DJ ðŸ˜Ž
- switch between songs
